# Minesweeper
 I made Minesweeper the game using tkinter and OOP in python. this is the version where you might need to guess on some times. this is the explanation of the code. <br>
 there are 3 difficulty levels, "not so easy", "kinda hard" and "DO NOT PRESS" (named such beacuse a single cell click took 4-5 seconds to update, you'll be genuinely frustrated playing in this mode).<br>
 to play the game, run the main.py file.

 ## main.py
 this contains the code for starting the game, choosing the difficulty
